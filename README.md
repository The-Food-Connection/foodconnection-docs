## PURPOSE

‘The Food Connection’ ……. Food for Everyone.

When thinking about a business model for a web application, we discussed the things that have hit society the most in the last 2 years.  COVID19 changed the way many Australians think about being home together, and what you can do as a family or friend unit that creates joy and positivity.  The answer to that has revolved around food.  If you search online Tik Tok and YouTube are filled with beautiful videos where people make food for you to either make it along with them, or to just relax watching.  Our idea for ‘The Food Connection’ was born from this need for connection in your kitchen at home, where you might be cooking alone, or not be able to order in food for something special to brighten your week.

We wanted to create a place where you could store your favourite recipes, and refer to them easily later.  Where you can house your ancient family recipes that mean so much, and allow your friends and family to sign up and access them easily too. 

There are other applications around online currently that offer similar services to what we want to offer, but we found they have an Ecommerce approach, where the main goal is to sell a product. ‘The Food Connection’ is about the connection food brings between people, and how important that can be for people that are struggling with isolation or are unable to go out and buy food easily.  Using what you have in your pantry to create something your family can enjoy is priceless.  

Our goal is to create a place where you can save and use your own recipes, but also take inspiration from other recipes you may have never seen.  Whether it’s a stranger from another country, or your friends and family, you can find recipes to try out without feeling the pressure of needing to purchase anything.

Enjoy The Connection of Food.....

## TARGET AUDIENCE

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, everyday life changed completely, especially in regions where lockdowns were implemented to try to cease the spread of the virus. Then countless people lost their jobs or started working or studying from home, some restaurants were affected by going bankrupt or temporarily closing.

These people who had their lives affected began to look for alternatives to save money or to increase the connection between their loved ones at home, one of them was searching on the internet for recipes to cook, to learn to cook, to spend the free time developing a new hobby.

The number of websites or social media pages focused on sharing food recipes has grown in recent months. Although competition is high due to numerous recipe sharing websites, this application does not seek to market recipes, but to benefit users by being like an online cookbook in which the user can not only share their own recipes, but also save recipes from other users, rating and reviewing other recipes.

People who have extra time and want to store family's recipes that they can then find easily later. 

People who would like to share good recipes with others who share the same taste or culture and would like to reduce the stress of the lockdown, cooking a childhood memory that would bring comfort.

People who would like to learn different recipes, as they have more free time or the restaurants in their areas closed. They stay at home with family members during lockdowns and want a variety of meals.

People who look for recipes online and test at home as a hobby, a way of improving cooking skills or just to try new and different flavours.

People who want to innovate in the kitchen cooking different recipes and improve their cooking skills and surprise their family with a new meal.
